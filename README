# NIM Benchmark System

**⚠️ WARNING: This software is currently under development and is released for testing and debugging purposes only. Use at your own risk.**

## Overview
NIM Benchmark System is a tool designed to benchmark NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIMs). It provides a web interface for managing NIMs, running benchmarks, and analyzing performance metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 16.x or higher
- Docker with NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- NVIDIA GPU with appropriate drivers
- NGC API Key



### Frontend Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.7.9",
    "lucide-react": "^0.263.1",
    "react": "^18.2.0",

    "recharts": "^2.1.10"
  }
}
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nim-benchmark
```

2. Set up the backend:
